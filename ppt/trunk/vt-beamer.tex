\begin{frame}{Introduction}{What the heck is this?}
\begin{itemize}
\item A presentation template for the \LaTeX package \BEAMER.
\item \BEAMER theme files for a Virginia Tech look.

\begin{frame}{Caveats}
\begin{itemize}
\item The current output will not display properly with Adobe Acrobat Reader
if PNG graphics are included.  This is due to some issue with gamma.
{\texttt kpdf} and other Unix PDF programs seem to work.
\item Work is not complete on the handout, notes, and article versions.
\item The color theme was developed with the \BEAMER theme Antibes.  It is
unknown how well it will work with other themes.
\end{itemize}
