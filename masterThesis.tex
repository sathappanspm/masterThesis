(ABSTRACT)

\vfill

\end{center}

Civil unrest (protests, strikes, and ``occupy'' events) is a common occurrence in both democracies and authoritarian regimes. The study of civil unrest is a key topic for political scientists as it helps capture an important mechanism by which citizenry express themselves. In countries where civil unrest is lawful, qualitative analysis has revealed that more than 75\% of the protests are planned, organized, and/or announced in advance; therefore detecting future time mentions in relevant news and social media is a simple way to develop a protest forecasting system. We develop such a system in this paper, using a combination of key phrase learning to identify what to look for, probabilistic soft logic to reason about location occurrences in extracted results, and time normalization to resolve future tense mentions. We illustrate the application of our system to 10 countries in Latin America, viz. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Results demonstrate our successes in capturing significant societal unrest in these countries with an average lead time of 4.08 days. We also study the selective superiorities of news media versus social media (Twitter, Facebook) to identify relevant tradeoffs.

\chapter{Discussion}
We have described an approach to forecasting protests by detecting mentions of future events in news and social
media. The two twin issues of i) resolving the date and ii) resolving the location have been addressed satisfactorily
to realize an effective protest forecasting system. As different forms of communication media gain usage, systems
like ours will be crucial to understanding the concerns of citizenry.

Our future work is aimed at three aspects. First, to address situations such as nationwide protests and systems of protests,
we must generalize our system from generating protests at a single article level to digesting groups of articles. This will
require more sophisticated reasoning using PSL programs. 
Second, we would like to generalize our approach that currently
does detection of overt plans for protest to not-so-explicitly stated expressions of discontent. 
Finally, we plan to consider other population-level events of interest than just civil unrest, e.g., domestic political crises,
and design detectors to recognize the imminence of such events.
